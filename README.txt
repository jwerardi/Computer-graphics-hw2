For this assignment, I was able to create a line fractal but I was not able to create the arc fractal. I really struggled with
the concept of this problem. 

I was able to successfully complete the second part of the assignment, the wheel creation web application. 

I also allowed the user to customize the canvas' pen thickness and color. 

For this assignment, I referred to w3 and the MDN docs for HTML5 canvas help.
